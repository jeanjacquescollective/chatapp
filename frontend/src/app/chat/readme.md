# Hydration Errors in Web Development

A hydration error occurs in web development when there is a mismatch between the server-rendered HTML and the client-side JavaScript that takes over and "hydrates" the HTML. This is particularly relevant in frameworks like React that support server-side rendering (SSR).

## Hydration Process

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: The initial HTML is generated on the server and sent to the client. This HTML is fully formed and can be displayed immediately.
2. **Hydration**: Once the HTML is loaded in the browser, the client-side JavaScript takes over. It attaches event listeners and makes the HTML interactive. This process is called hydration.

## Causes of Hydration Errors

Hydration errors occur when the HTML generated on the server does not match the HTML generated on the client. Common causes include:

- **State Mismatches**: Differences in initial state between server and client.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Components that render differently on the server and client.
- **Side Effects**: Code that runs differently on the server and client, such as `useEffect` hooks.

## Example in Your Code

In your code, you use the `isMounted` state to prevent rendering until the component is mounted on the client side:

```javascript
if (!isMounted) {
    return null;
}
```

This ensures that the component only renders on the client side, preventing potential hydration errors that could occur if the server-rendered HTML differs from the client-rendered HTML.

## Why This Matters

Hydration errors can lead to inconsistencies in the UI and unexpected behavior. By ensuring that certain parts of your component only render on the client side, you can avoid these issues and ensure a smoother user experience.
